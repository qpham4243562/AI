# Super Mario World AI-NEAT

This repository holds my tutorial code for an Open-AI and NEAT mario World Bot. 

You can find my video on the AI here: https://youtu.be/fkvc9Qc5ycE


The code is poorly documented (if any) and may have some extra files. Marioworld.py is the main AI file. 3 checkpoints have been included: 260 checkpoint is somewhere in Yoshi island 1. The checkpoint files YoshiIsland1 and YoshiIsland2 are the save of when the AI completed the level.


If you want to set up the AI, I recommend following some of the videos in this playlist. He shows how to set up the Open AI Retro.
